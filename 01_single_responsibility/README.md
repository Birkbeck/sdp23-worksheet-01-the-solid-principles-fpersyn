# Single Responsibility Principle

**Every class should have a single responsibility. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.**

This example is derived from a Tic Tac Toe game. 

You are provided with a generic Board class that does board-related things â€” it stores the values of spots on the board, returns the board's rows, and prints the board out to the screen. On the surface, everything seems legitimately related to a real-world Board object, but the *Single Responsibility Principle* tells us that this class is actually handling far too many responsibilities.

How would you correct this situation?
* Board contains 2 responsibilities: (1) data & domain logic; (2) visualisation;
* Moving the visualisation responsibility to its own class BoardUI taking a Board as input would resolve SRP.
* Some other design principle issues remain in the BoardUI class: DRY
